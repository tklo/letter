Dear Sir or Madam,

My main motivation of this application is the the desire of self-improvement as an entrepreneur and a professional DevOps engineer. I am also very excited about the prospects of working in the international environment.

I am interested in the modern IT, especially Linux and automation and configuration management technologies. I am a passionate Linux desktop user for over 13 years. I have had experience with Java, C++ and Python programming languages during the course of my studies and my professional career.
I am especially fascinated in the notion of DevOps and configuration management. I already had an opportunity to work in the capacity of System Engineer responsible for a set of modern technology Proof of Concept projects. This included evaluating cloud computing technologies (OpenStack, Eucalyptus, OpenNebula), infrastructure configuration management (Chef) and big data (Cloudera Hadoop). On this position For over two years I have been a member of Scrum-powered Java development team focused on Machine 2 Machine (Internet of Things), Cloud Computing and Big Data.

My third job (Linux Polska) has given me a possibility of designing and developing Jenkins-based automation workflow for massive RPM packages building. The system was used by the company to create their own Scientific Linux clone adjusted to their internal needs.

Finally, my current position is a System Engineer in two CERN Control Center’s teams: DevOps and Infrastructure. In the first team I have been working mostly on maintenance of Elasticsearch-Kibana-Logalike cluster (Logalike is CERN’s version of Logstash). In the Infrastructure team along with my daily support and troubleshooting tasks, I have been involved in numerous activities in System Administration Modernisation project. My responsibilities in the project have been mostly related to the transformation of an old bash/awk/Python script-based configuration management to a modern Ansible-based solution. I have worked also on support of critical servers for the operation of accelerators.


Thank you for your consideration,
