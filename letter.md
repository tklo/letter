Dear Hiring Manager,

I am a Linux System Engineer with more than 4 years experience in automation and configuration management (Ansible, Chef). Currently I am working at CERN Control Center, where I am responsible for support and troubleshooting of almost 3000 machines, developing Ansible configuration and maintenance of our Elasticsearch data cluster.

I am M.A. graduate of IT (Databases) at Polish-Japanese Academy of Information Technology in Warsaw, B.A. graduate of Computer Science and B.A. graduate of Business Management, both held in English, at University of Lodz. I posses RHCE and RHCSA certificates and I have been passionate Linux user for over 13 years. Open Source movement was always important to me and I have started engaging in it early. In the high school I was running a website supporting Polish community of Fedora Linux users.

DevOps is central concept to vision of my career. I have become so fascinated by the idea of  building bridges between development and operations and of treating infrastructure as a code that I have decided to use and describe this phenomenon in my M.A. thesis on Cloud Computing. It involved a Vagrant and Chef project aiming at configuring a Hybrid Cloud based on Amazon Web Services and OpenStack.

My main motivation of this application is the desire of self-improvement as an Entrepreneur and a professional DevOps Engineer. I am also very enthusiastic by the prospects of working in an international environment. I have studied and worked in multinational, English-speaking environment for last 9 years.

Automating  processes of development, testing, configuration and deployment of software has been subject of my professional interest since I got my second job at IMPAQ four years ago. For over two years I have been a member of Scrum-powered Java development team focused on development of Machine 2 Machine (Internet of Things), Cloud Computing and Big Data applications. This team of enthusiastic developers made me aware of the importance and significance of Agile methodologies.

At my third job, at Linux Polska, I have designed and implemented a Jenkins-based automation workflow for massive RPM packages building. The system was used by the company to create their own Scientific Linux clone adjusted to their internal needs. I have been also responsible for the monitoring of the system with Zabbix.

For last year I have been member of two teams at CERN: DevOps and Infrastructure. In the first team I have been working mostly on maintenance of Elasticsearch-Kibana-Logalike cluster. In the Infrastructure team along with my daily support and troubleshooting tasks, I have been involved in numerous activities in System Administration Modernisation project. My responsibilities in the project have been mostly related to the transformation of an old bash/awk/Python script-based configuration management to a modern Ansible-based solution. The servers that I have been working with are critical to the operation of CERN accelerators.

I am fascinated by modern patterns of design and implementation of efficient, secure and scalable platforms that can be easily maintained, integrated with external services and extended when new needs appear. I believe in Agile project management of self-motivating teams focused on delivering well-crafted, featureful and reliable systems.

The worst possible combination of a projectâ€™s organization is lack of team cooperation and micromanagement. I am in favor of empowering teams to be proactive and independent. As a Business Management graduate I have learned and I have always believed that manager is a person who builds an environment in which his team can flourish on its own. Therefore I always strive to be a self-managed team player.

Thank you for your consideration,
