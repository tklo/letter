Dear Hiring Manager,

I am a 28 year old Linux System Engineer with more than 4 years experience in automation and configuration management (Ansible, Chef) of various services. Currently I'm working at CERN Control Center, where I am responsible for support and troubleshooting of almost 3000 machines, developing Ansible configuration and maintenance of our Elasticsearch data cluster.

I am M.A. graduate of IT (Databases) at Polish-Japanese Academy of Information Technology in Warsaw, B.A. graduate of Computer Science and B.A. graduate of Business Management, both held in English, at University of Lodz. I posses RHCE and RHCSA certificates and I have been passionate Linux user for over 13 years. Open Source movement was always important to me and I’ve started engaging in it early. In the high school I was running a website supporting Polish community of Fedora Linux users.

DevOps is central concept to vision of my career. I’ve become so fascinated by the idea of  building bridges between development and operations and of treating infrastructure as a code that I have decided to use and describe this phenomenon in my M.A. thesis on Cloud Computing. It involved a Vagrant and Chef project aiming at configuring a Hybrid Cloud based on Amazon Web Services and OpenStack.

As an enthusiastic, results-oriented team player, focused on development of my Big Data, Cloud and DevOps skills, my main motivation of this application is the desire of self-improvement as an Entrepreneur and a professional DevOps Engineer. I am also very excited by the prospects of working in an international environment in a renowned Swiss company. I’ve studied and worked in multinational, mainly English-speaking environment for last 9 years.

Automating  processes of development, testing, configuration and deployment of software has been subject of my professional interest since I got my second job at IMPAQ four years ago. For over two years I have been a member of Scrum-powered Java development team focused on development of Machine 2 Machine (Internet of Things), Cloud Computing and Big Data applications. This team of enthusiastic developers made me aware of the importance and significance of Agile methodologies.

I worked at IMPAQ in the capacity of System Engineer responsible for a set of modern technology Proof of Concept projects. This included evaluating cloud computing technologies (OpenStack, Eucalyptus, OpenNebula), infrastructure configuration management (Chef) and big data (Cloudera Hadoop).

My third job, at Linux Polska, gave me a possibility of designing and developing Jenkins-based automation workflow for massive RPM packages building. The system was used by the company to create their own Scientific Linux clone adjusted to their internal needs.

For last year I have been member of two teams at CERN: DevOps and Infrastructure. In the first team I have been working mostly on maintenance of Elasticsearch-Kibana-Logalike cluster. In the Infrastructure team along with my daily support and troubleshooting tasks, I have been involved in numerous activities in System Administration Modernisation project. My responsibilities in the project have been mostly related to the transformation of an old bash/awk/Python script-based configuration management to a modern Ansible-based solution. The servers that I have been working with are critical to the operation of CERN accelerators.

I’m fascinated by modern patterns of design and implementation of efficient, secure and scalable platforms that can be easily maintained, integrated with external services and extended when new needs appear. I believe in Agile project management of self-motivating teams focused on delivering well-crafted, featureful and reliable systems.

The worst possible combination of a project’s organization is lack of team cooperation and micromanagement. Thus I’m glad that Swisscom empowers its teams to be proactive and independent. As a Business Management graduate I’ve learned and I’ve always believed that manager is a person who builds an environment in which his team can flourish on its own. Therefore I always strive to be a self-managed team player.

Finally, I’m happy that I’m taking part in the direct recruitment at Swisscom. This indicates that the company is engaged in a stable, long-term cooperation with its employees. For me it is one of the signs that Swisscom is a good employer.

Thank you for your consideration.
